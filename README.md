# Calvin

Calvin is a simple dependency injection container for JavaScript.

This is currently a pre-release library. Documentation and test suite forthcoming.

> This was modeled after [redradix/kontainer](https://github.com/redradix/kontainer), but written from scratch with a few added featuers and slightly more complex error handling. Give that original library some love.
